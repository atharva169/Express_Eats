                               <br>- For the Filling: Boiled potatoes, spices (such as cumin, coriander powder, garam masala, and chili powder), chopped cilantro, and salt.
                            
                            <br>2. **Preparation**:
                               <br>- **Dough**: Knead the whole wheat flour with water, salt, and oil to form a smooth dough. Rest it for 20-30 minutes.

                               <br>- Gently roll the stuffed dough into a flat circle.
                            
                            <br>4. **Cooking**:
                               <br>- Heat a griddle or tawa and cook the rolled paratha on both sides, applying oil or ghee until golden brown.
                            
                            <br>5. **Serving**:

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions or some combination of the above.

                        <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                        <p><br>3 eggs, beaten
                            <br>1 tsp sunflower oil
                            <br>1 tsp butter
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.
                            2. Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.
                            3. Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.
                            4. Fill the omelette: Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds
                            5. Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.

                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. If your chicken breasts are too big, slice them before cooking. Then, marinade the chicken breasts in the Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, mustard, or all-spice powder. Leave the chicken for at least four hours or over night.
                            <br>2. An egg and two tablespoons of water should be beaten together to make the batter, which should then be set aside.
                            <br>3. Chicken breasts that have been marinated should be heavily dusted in flour. They should be well coated after being dipped in both the egg and the breadcrumbs.
                            <br>4. The coated chicken breasts should be deep-fried in heated oil over a medium-high heat until they are crisp and golden brown.
                            <br>5. The finished burger should be stacked with the lettuce on top, followed by the chicken, and then the mayonnaise or KFC zinger sauce. The buns should be cut in half and lightly toasted. If you'd like a cheesy kick, add some sliced American cheese.

                            <br>½ teaspoon black pepper
                            <br>½ teaspoon coarse salt
                            <br>4 eggs
                            <br>¼ cup mozzarella cheese, grated
                            <br>¼ cup cheddar cheese, grated
                            <br>Extra virgin olive oil for extra drizzling
                            <br>Fresh cilantro roughly chopped, thinly sliced chives for garnish
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Preheat oven to 400˚F. Place strips of bacon in a large (at least 10 inch), oven safe skillet. Cook over medium low heat on both sides until cooked through but not yet crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat to a paper towel lined plate and set aside, leaving the bacon grease in the pan. When the bacon is cool enough to handle, roughly dice.
                            <br>Increase the heat to medium high, add the potatoes, bell pepper, and onion and cook for 7- 8 minutes, stirring frequently, until starting to soften and can be pierced with a fork
                            <br>Add garlic, cumin, chili powder, paprika, black pepper, and salt. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until garlic is fragrant.
                            <br>Using a spoon, create 4 to 6 holes (depending on how many eggs you want) in the hash mixture for the eggs. Distribute the cheeses evenly into each hole, and then crack one egg into each hole.
                            <br>Place in the preheat oven and cook for 8-10 minutes, until egg white is set but the yolk is still runny.
                            <br>Remove from heat. Sprinkle with cooked bacon. Garnish with fresh ground black pepper, cilantro and chives.
